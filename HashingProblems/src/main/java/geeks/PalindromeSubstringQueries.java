/**
 * Question:
 * Given a string and several queries on the substrings of the given input string to check whether
 * the substring is a palindrome or not.

 Examples :
 Suppose our input string is “abaaabaaaba” and the queries- [0, 10], [5, 8], [2, 5], [5, 9]

 We have to tell that the substring having the starting and ending indices as above is a palindrome or not.

 [0, 10] → Substring is “abaaabaaaba” which is a palindrome.
 [5, 8] → Substring is “baaa” which is not a palindrome.
 [2, 5] → Substring is “aaab” which is not a palindrome.
 [5, 9] → Substring is “baaab” which is a palindrome.

 Let us assume that there are Q such queries to be answered and N be the length of our input string.
