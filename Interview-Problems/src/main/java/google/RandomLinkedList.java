 * There is a linked list of numbers of length N. N is very large and you donâ€™t know N.
 * You have to write a function that will return k random numbers from the list. Numbers should be completely random.

 Hint:

 1. Use random function rand() (returns a number between 0 and 1) and irand()
 (return either 0 or 1)
 2. It should be done in O(n).

     * you from going through the list more than once. Say the list is very long and cannot fit in memory.
